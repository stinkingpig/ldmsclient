LANDesk's client inventory system is very powerful in that it can be easily extended. Unfortunately, it gets a lot less simple when you've pushed out five different scripts and deployed some new clients, and who knows what system is scanning for what extension. This program attempts to solve that problem, by providing a single extension and dat file which implements all the handy extensions as subroutines. Its configuration is read at runtime from a configuration file on the core server, so the administrator can turn parts on and off centrally.
